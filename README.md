# "Four Equations" Puzzle and Solution

## Background
During a recent visit to The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry ([OMSI](https://omsi.edu/) for short), I came across a puzzle that had a 3 x 3 grid and some wooden blocks with the numbers 1 through 9 printed on them.
The problem was called `Four Equations`, and the goal of the puzzle was to arrange the numbered blocks in a certain pattern that met the following constraints:

| Row or Column    | Constraint |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Row 1    | The first number minus the second number equals the third number. |
| Row 2    | The first number divided by the second number equals the third number. |
| Row 3    | The first number plus the second number equals the third number. |
| Column 1 | The first number times the second number equals the third number. |

To better visualize this, see the below picture of the puzzle with its blocks jumbled:

## Motivation
As you might infer from the picture of the wooden blocks and simple, giant print, this was a puzzle for children, and I couldn't solve it in the 5-10 minutes I tried.
Slightly annoyed, I gave up, sanitized my hands, and said I'd solve it later with a computer.

## Number of Possible Solutions
The way to calculate the total number of possible solutions to this puzzle is to use factorials.
There are 9 starting blocks to choose from.
After you choose one, there are 8 remaining blocks to choose from.
After you choose another, there are 7 remaining blocks, and so on until you run out.

That means that the number of possible solutions is `9!` or "nine factorial".
This can also be written as:
```
9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
```

When you evaluate the expression `9!`, you get the number 362,880.
So, that's the number of  "naive guesses" it would take to guarantee that you either get the answer or prove there isn't one.

Of course, the number of possible solutions goes way down when you consider the relationships among the numbers and their operators.
For example, row 2 divides its first number by its second.
Since 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime, none of them can go in row 2, box 1.
In that same vein, the 9th box is the product of two numbers, so none of the primes can go there since we don't have any duplicates, and a prime number only has two factors: one and the prime itself.

So, you could solve the problem like a Sudoku or any other logic puzzle.
But, I have a computer, and I don't have time for that!

## Solving it with Python

There are 3 main pieces to my simple Python program:
1. Generate a list of all possible permutations of the numbers 1 through 9.
2. See if a given permutation meets the constraints, thereby solving the puzzle.
3. If the permutation *does* solve the puzzle, print it as a 3 x 3 grid.

### Getting All Possible Permutations
Rather than reinvent the wheel, I used the `permutations()` function from Python's `itertools` module.
This function returns all possible permutations of an iterable like a list of numbers.
Here's an example of the code that gets me the list:
```
from itertools import permutations

# Generate a list of 1-9 (up to but excluding 10)
one_thru_nine = list(range(1, 10))

all_perms = list(permutations(one_thru_nine))
```

### Constraint Checking
To check if a given permutation solves the puzzle, I used Python assertions.
An assertion is just a statement that, if true, does nothing and moves on.
However, if an assertion proves to be false, it raises an error.
This error is called an `AssertionError`.

Here's a snippet that shows how to check if the first element plus the second element equals the third:
```
def check_solution(p):
    """Given a list "p", return True if the first element
       minus the second element equals the third."""

    try:
        assert p[0] - p[1] == p[2]
    except AssertionError:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

In the above code, we make a function called `check_solution`.
This function takes a list called `p`.
Since `p` is a `list` object, the first element has an index of 0.
That means the first element in the list is called `p[0]`, and the second one is `p[1]`, and the third is `p[2]`.

So, we assert that `p[0] - p[1] == p[2]`.
If this is true, as in the case `3 - 2 == 1` then the function skips to the `else` section and returns a value of `True`.
If that assertion is false, for example `4 - 2 == 7` then an `AssertionError` is raised by our function.
We "handle" that error by simply returning `False`.

The above example only solves one of the three constraints, but we can use assertions to test addition, division, and multiplication just like we did for subtraction.

### Printing the Result
This part of the code just takes an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) of 9 elements and prints it as a 3 x 3 grid:
```
def render(l):
    """Render a 3x3 grid of a list `l`."""
    try:
        assert len(l) == 9
    except AssertionError:
        print(f"Expected list of length 9. Got length {len(l)}")

    first_row = f"{l[0]}  {l[1]}  {l[2]}"
    second_row = f"{l[3]}  {l[4]}  {l[5]}"
    third_row = f"{l[6]}  {l[7]}  {l[8]}"
    leading = " " * len(first_row)
    padding = '-' * len(first_row)

    rows = [padding, first_row, leading, second_row, leading, third_row, padding]
    for row in rows:
        print(row)
```

## Solving the Puzzle
With all the math riff-raff out of the way, you can solve this puzzle by using Python 3 to run my accompanying script called `grid_puzzle.py`.

The answer gets rendered to the screen as follows:
```
Solution found! ðŸŸ¢
-------
9  5  4

6  3  2

1  7  8
-------
```

Since my list of possible solutions grew sequentially, it took a lot of guesses for the computer to get it right.
Specifically, it took exactly 345,295 guesses!

## Conclusion

I am now armed with the computational power to brute-force a childrens' puzzle.
The next time someone asks me if I'm smarter than a fifth grader, I can respond more confidently than ever with a resounding, "Probably!".
