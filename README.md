# Puzzle Grid and Solution

## Background
During a visit to OMSI on April 10th, I came across a puzzle that had a 3 x 3 grid and blocks with the numbers 1 - 9 printed on them.
The problem was called `Four Equations`, and the goal of the puzzle was to arrange the numbered blocks in a certain pattern that met the following constraints:

| Row or Column    | Constraint |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Row 1    | The first number minus the second number equals the third number. |
| Row 2    | The first number divided by the second number equals the third number. |
| Row 3    | The first number plus the second number equals the third number. |
| Column 1 | The first number times the second number equals the third number. |
